This report explores factors impacting airline passenger satisfaction using a machine learning approach. It analyzes supervised models like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Neural Networks, and unsupervised models like K-Means and DBSCAN to predict and understand passenger satisfaction levels. Feature selection techniques (e.g., Chi-Square) are employed to refine the models, enhancing predictive accuracy and uncovering patterns in passenger experiences. The findings help guide airlines in improving service quality and operational efficiency based on passenger feedback.
